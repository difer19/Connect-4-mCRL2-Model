# mCRL2 Specifications for Connect 4 and Parallel Minimax

This repository contains formal specifications using mCRL2 for the Connect 4 game and a parallel version of the Minimax algorithm, along with the properties that have been formally verified.

## Description

The purpose of this repository is to provide a formal specification and property verification of a parallel implementation of the Minimax algorithm using mCRL2, a modeling language and a tool for the formal analysis of concurrent systems.

### Repository Contents

- **mCRL2 Specifications**: Specification files for the Connect 4 game and the parallel Minimax algorithm.
- **Verified Properties**: List of properties that have been formally verified.

## Features

- Complete specifications of the Connect 4 game and its AI logic.
- Implementation of the Minimax algorithm in its parallel form.
- Verification of critical properties.

## Requirements

To use this project, mCRL2 must be installed. It can be downloaded from the [official mCRL2 website](https://www.mcrl2.org).
